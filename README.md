# realTimeBusTracker
## Project Description
This web app gets the current locations of all Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ("MBTA") buses, then plots them on a map.
General features:
1. MBTA bus locations refreshed every 15 seconds.
2. Buses are color coded, and the included legend provides the bus IDs for each color.

## How to Run
(1) Download the following 3 files from this repository into a directory on your local machine: 
<ul>
  <li>mapanimation.js</li>
  <li>styles.css</li>
  <li>index.html</li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in your favorite (and modern) browser.

## Roadmap
Plan to add a button for help information
