# realTimeBusTracker
## Project Description
This web app gets the current locations of all Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority ("MBTA") buses, then plots them on a map.
### General features:
1. Bus locations refreshed every 15 seconds.
2. Buses are color coded. There is a legend showing the respective bus code.

## How to Run
(1) Download the following 3 files from this repository into a directory on your local machine: 
<ul>
  <li>mapanimation.js</li>
  <li>styles.css</li>
  <li>index.html</li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in browser. Google Chrome is the preferred browser.

## Roadmap
Plan to add a help button. Also, I would like to change the pins to images of buses, and potentially watch them move in live time via the route they are taking.
